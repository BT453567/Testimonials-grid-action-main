        <p class="sub-quote">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code.
        I needed same structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
        I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
        about Ihe program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and I never had Lo wait bug for assistance. The agile team project , in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
        In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
        It certainly helped ne land a job as a fuIIstack developer after receiving multiple offers,
        100% recorrmend!"</p>
